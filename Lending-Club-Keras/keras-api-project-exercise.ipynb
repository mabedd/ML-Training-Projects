As the saying goes, don't put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\n","2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \"dirty data\" to \"clean data.\"\n","3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\n","4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\n","5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It's important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\n","6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you've trained your model based on a subset of your data, it's time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven't overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\n","7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \"bionic man\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you're able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\" rate."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"O2np4MWOnkRq"},"source":["# # Keras API Project Exercise\n","\n","## The Data\n","\n","We will be using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club\n","\n","## NOTE: Do not download the full zip from the link!

In addition, we see we may have potential outliers in age and fare. However, since they are reasonable values, we will wait until after we complete our exploratory analysis to determine if we should include or exclude from the dataset. It should be noted, that if they were unreasonable values, for example age = 800 instead of 80, then it's probably a safe decision to fix now. However, we want to use caution when we modify data from its original value, because it may be necessary to create an accurate model.\n","2. **Completing:** There are null values or missing data in the age, cabin, and embarked field. Missing values can be bad, because some algorithms don't know how-to handle null values and will fail. While others, like decision trees, can handle null values. Thus, it's important to fix before we start modeling, because we will compare and contrast several models. There are two common methods, either delete the record or populate the missing value using a reasonable input. It is not recommended to delete the record, especially a large percentage of records, unless it truly represents an incomplete record. Instead, it's best to impute missing values. A basic methodology for qualitative data is impute using mode. A basic methodology for quantitative data is impute using mean, median, or mean + randomized standard deviation. An intermediate methodology is to use the basic methodology based on specific criteria; like the average age by class or embark port by fare and SES. There are more complex methodologies, however before deploying, it should be compared to the base model to determine if complexity truly adds value. For this dataset, age will be imputed with the median, the cabin attribute will be dropped, and embark will be imputed with mode. Subsequent model iterations may modify this decision to determine if it improves the model’s accuracy.\n","3. **Creating:**  Feature engineering is when we use existing features to create new features to determine if they provide new signals to predict our outcome.

Most data scientist come from one of the three fields, so they tend to lean towards that discipline. However, data science is like a three-legged stool, with no one leg being more important than the other. So, this step will require advanced knowledge in mathematics. But don’t worry, we only need a high-level overview, which we’ll cover in this Kernel. Also, thanks to computer science, a lot of the heavy lifting is done for you. So, problems that once required graduate degrees in mathematics or statistics, now only take a few lines of code. Last, we’ll need some business acumen to think through the problem. After all, like training a sight-seeing dog, it’s learning from us and not the other way around.\n","\n","Machine Learning (ML), as the name suggest, is teaching the machine how-to think and not what to think. While this topic and big data has been around for decades, it is becoming more popular than ever because the barrier to entry is lower, for businesses and professionals alike. This is both good and bad. It’s good because these algorithms are now accessible to more people that can solve more problems in the real-world. It’s bad because a lower barrier to entry means, more people will not know the tools they are using and can come to incorrect conclusions. That’s why I focus on teaching you, not just what to do, but why you’re doing it. Previously, I used the analogy of asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible; or even worst, implements incorrect actionable intelligence. So now that I’ve hammered (no pun intended) my point, I’ll show you what to do and most importantly, WHY you do it.\n","\n","First, you must understand, that the purpose of machine learning is to solve human problems. Machine learning can be categorized as: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforced learning. Supervised learning is where you train the model by presenting it a training dataset that includes the correct answer. Unsupervised learning is where you train the model using a training dataset that does not include the correct answer. And reinforced learning is a hybrid of the previous two, where the model is not given the correct answer immediately, but later after a sequence of events to reinforce learning. We are doing supervised machine learning, because we are training our algorithm by presenting it with a set of features and their corresponding target. We then hope to present it a new subset from the same dataset and have similar results in prediction accuracy.\n","\n","There are many machine learning algorithms, however they can be reduced to four categories: classification, regression, clustering, or dimensionality reduction, depending on your target variable and data modeling goals. We'll save clustering and dimension reduction for another day, and focus on classification and regression. We can generalize that a continuous target variable requires a regression algorithm and a discrete target variable requires a classification algorithm. One side note, logistic regression, while it has regression in the name, is really a classification algorithm. Since our problem is predicting if a passenger survived or did not survive, this is a discrete target variable. We will use a classification algorithm from the *sklearn* library to begin our analysis. We will use cross validation and scoring metrics, discussed in later sections, to rank and compare our algorithms’ performance.\n","\n","**Machine Learning Selection:**\n","* [Sklearn Estimator Overview](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)\n","* [Sklearn Estimator Detail](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html)\n","* [Choosing Estimator Mind Map](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html)\n","* [Choosing Estimator Cheat Sheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Scikit_Learn_Cheat_Sheet_Python.pdf)\n","\n","\n","Now that we identified our solution as a supervised learning classification algorithm.

In short, NFLT states, there is no super algorithm, that works best in all situations, for all datasets. So the best approach is to try multiple MLAs, tune them, and compare them for your specific scenario. With that being said, some good research has been done to compare algorithms, such as [Caruana & Niculescu-Mizil 2006](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~caruana/ctp/ct.papers/caruana.icml06.pdf) watch [video lecture here](http://videolectures.net/solomon_caruana_wslmw/) of MLA comparisons, [Ogutu et al. 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3103196/) done by the NIH for genomic selection, [Fernandez-Delgado et al. 2014](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/delgado14a/delgado14a.pdf) comparing 179 classifiers from 17 families, [Thoma 2016 sklearn comparison](https://martin-thoma.com/comparing-classifiers/), and there is also a school of thought that says, [more data beats a better algorithm](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/06/machine-learning-more-data-better-algorithms.html). \n","\n","So with all this information, where is a beginner to start? I recommend starting with [Trees, Bagging, Random Forests, and Boosting](http://jessica2.msri.org/attachments/10778/10778-boost.pdf). They are basically different implementations of a decision tree, which is the easiest concept to learn and understand. They are also easier to tune, discussed in the next section, than something like SVC. Below, I'll give an overview of how-to run and compare several MLAs, but the rest of this Kernel will focus on learning data modeling via decision trees and its derivatives."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZA5RdJmAnkSC"},"source":["# Creating the Model\n","\n","**TASK: Run the cell below to import the necessary Keras functions.**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"hNSIwUDwnkSC"},"source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense,Dropout"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7nEhTroankSC"},"source":["**TASK: Build a sequential model to will be trained on the data.
